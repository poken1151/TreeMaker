Known Bugs:

	- This includes primarily the hemi-ellipses.
	
- Editing the "Number of Points" for some cloud types changes their spawn location.

- Camera up-down rotation inverts on the other side: negative looking into positive Z.

- Object positions may change slightly (round up/down) during select-deselect. 
	- This has to do with the way the location's stored.
